# HANDOFF NOTE — ED fire submodule (Model C)

Last updated: 2026-05-21. Read `CLAUDE.md` first for environment, file locations, and conventions.
This note is the "where are we, what's next" narrative.

## TL;DR

The Model C burned-area submodule has been refit to be **coupled-consistent with Lei's ED GPP** and
tuned against **GFED5**. It is the canonical shipped model. A bundle was prepared for Lei. Seasonal
visualizations were built for Hurtt. The main open scientific problem is **tropical-forest false fire**
(we burn the Amazon/Congo interior where GFED5 is near zero).

## Where we are

### The model (canonical, shipped)
- Burned area: ILAMB Overall **0.6482, rank #3 of 10 external TRENDY** (behind CLM6 0.6562, ELM-FATES 0.6502).
- Fire emissions: ILAMB Overall **0.6465, rank #5 of 10**.
- Files: see CLAUDE.md "canonical model" table. `models/C/params.json` is the live parameter set.

### How it was produced (in order, all done)
1. Hybrid driver loader: CRUJRA climate + Lei's coupled GPP (closes Lei's correctness ask).
2. Fixed the optimizer scorer to be ILAMB-faithful Collier-2018 (centralized RMSE, crms normalizer,
   mass weighting). Earlier scorer was gaming the metric.
3. Constrained `fire_exp >= 1` so the suppression cascade behaves physically (values < 1 smear fire globally).
4. Added a physical objective: `0.55*ILAMB + 0.25*false_positive_score + 0.20*hotspot_score`, magnitude band.
5. NSGA-II multi-objective (ILAMB Overall vs false-positive rate) gave the best Pareto point -> canonical.
6. Retuned combustion betas for the new BA -> `betas.gfed5.json`.
7. A vegetation-AGB suppression term was tried; it did NOT help (0.6472 vs 0.6482), so it is OFF in the
   canonical model. The hook exists in `fire_C` (activates only if `k_veg`/`agb_crit` are in params).

### Figures built (in `NEW MAPS/`)
- `Hybrid_GFED5/BA_four_panel.png`, `fFire_four_panel.png`, bias stacks — model vs GFED5/CLM6/ELM-FATES.
- `Seasonal/1..4` — BA seasonal: global timeseries, regional cycles, peak-month map, Hovmoller.
- `Seasonal/5..8` — same four for fFire.
- `Seasonal/9_false_positive_map.png` — where we over-predict.

### Diagnosis of the over-prediction (important for the paper)
Area-weighted, Model C total is **1.26x GFED5** (1001 vs 793 Mha/yr) — close, better than CLM6/ELM-FATES
on magnitude. The error splits into:
- **False positives: 77 Mha (8%)** — fire where GFED5 is near-zero. Concentrated in **Amazonia (28 Mha)**,
  then SE Asia/Indonesia, E. North America, Central Africa forest, Europe.
- **Intensity: 1.16x** in cells that genuinely burn.
The single biggest fixable error is **tropical closed-canopy forest false fire** (Amazon, Congo). Our
climate+GPP formula sees productivity + seasonal dryness and lights forests that don't burn in reality.
This is exactly what CLM6's separate "tropical deforestation fire" type and ELM-FATES canopy structure
handle and we don't.

## What needs to be done (priority order)

1. **Send Lei the bundle** if not already sent. A draft email to Lei only (`lma6@umd.edu`, no CC) is in
   Gmail Drafts. The bundle is preserved at `NEW MAPS/Seasonal/modelC_for_lei_v2/` (the `/tmp` copy was
   cleared). Re-zip that folder and attach. Contents are the canonical model + maps + a README. NOTE the
   draft says "version that uses your full dump (climate too)" is available on request — we have NOT
   built that full-dump version; if Lei asks, re-run the optimizer with the climate drivers also read
   from the dump (revert `load_coupled_drivers` to pull D_bar/T_air/P_* from the dump).

2. **Tropical-forest false-fire fix (most promising scientific lever).** Add a suppression that kills
   fire in high-AGB closed-canopy cells, applied specifically to the tropics (not the global veg term we
   already tried). Target the 28 Mha Amazon error directly. Re-run NSGA-II, re-score, regenerate maps.
   This is the next real improvement, not more global tuning.

3. **Hurtt's seasonal-visualization request is DONE** (the `Seasonal/` figures). If he wants more, the
   natural additions are: per-region Taylor diagrams, or an interannual-variability (detrended anomaly)
   timeseries.

4. **Paper / writeup.** Framing points already established: we are the only model tuned to GFED5; Model C
   is coupled-consistent with ED's own GPP so it transfers into the coupled run; CLM6/Li2013 uses a
   four-fire-type structure (non-peat, agricultural, tropical-deforestation, peat) plus explicit
   ignition + population suppression that Model C lacks — that structural gap is the honest explanation
   for our residual over-prediction.

## Reproduce from scratch on the new machine

```bash
source $(conda info --base)/etc/profile.d/conda.sh && conda activate ed-fire
cd <repo>
# 1. regenerate BA from canonical params
python scripts/reproduce_modelC.py
# 2. emissions
python scripts/compute_emissions.py --model ED-ModelC-Hybrid \
  --betas-json models/combustion-params/betas.gfed5.json --out-suffix ""
# 3. score (see CLAUDE.md "How to score with official ILAMB")
```

## Data the new machine MUST have (large, mostly git-ignored)

These are not in git (`.gitignore` excludes `data/`). If the new computer syncs the same Google Drive
folder they come along automatically; otherwise copy them:
- `data/crujra/*_monthly.npy` (CRUJRA climate drivers)
- `global_baseline_modelC_inputs_1997-2016.nc` (Lei's coupled GPP dump, ~420 MB, repo root)
- `global_baseline_modelCfuel_inputs_1997-2016.nc` (AGB for emissions, repo root)
- `ilamb_ref_official/DATA/burntArea/GFED5/burntArea.nc` and `.../fFire/GFED5/fFire.nc` (references)
- `ilamb/MODELS_LEADERBOARD/` and `ilamb/MODELS_LEADERBOARD_FFIRE_GFED5/` (comparator TRENDY models)

## Housekeeping done this session

Cleaned ~4 GB of dead intermediate output: sync duplicates, ~53 stale `ilamb_out_*` dirs (kept only
`ilamb_out_nsga2_lb` and `ilamb_out_ffire_nsga2`), ~43 old logs, ~24 dead `params.*.json` and ~14 dead
`burntArea.*.nc` variants. Not yet touched (unsure, from earlier project phases): `models_full/`,
`out_terms/`, `stageB_models/`, `out_ffire/`, and the older `ED-ModelC-{GFED5,GFED5cont,GFED5type,
l02s7,Emissions,EmpiricalEmit}` leaderboard slots. Check references before deleting those.
